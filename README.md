# A World Without Hat
Rimworld "A World Without Hat" mod

"TX-50? You around?"

I AM HERE. HELLO, HUMAN. HOW MAY I HELP YOU.

"Yeah, so, uh. There's this . . . thing . . . that happened. With our clothes. You know anything about it?"

INDEED. IT WAS REQUESTED OF ME BY ZOYA.

". . . Why?"

SHE SPOKE OF A WONDEROUS REALITY. A REALITY OF JOY. A REALITY OF HAPPINESS. A REALITY WHERE ALL WOULD LIVE IN HAPPY UNITY.

"Gonna admit, I don't see the relevance.."

SHE SPOKE OF A WORLD WHERE WE COULD FIND JOY IN THE SMALLEST THINGS AND THE LARGEST THINGS. FOR EXAMPLE. DO YOU REMEMBER SEVERAL MONTHS AGO. THE CARAVAN THAT ARRIVED.

"Yeah. Yeah, I do. Why?"

DO YOU REMEMBER THE ENTITY KNOWN AS BLACK. HE WAS WEARING CLOTHES.

"Most humans wear clothes, TX. But, yes, I remember him."

DO YOU REMEMBER HIS HAIR.

"What?"

DO YOU REMEMEBER. HIS HAIR.

"I can honestly say that I do not remember his hair."

YES. EXACTLY.

"Uh."

HIS HAIR WAS GORGEOUS. IT FLOWED LIKE A RIVER OF DARKNESS. BUT ALSO LIKE A RIVER. IN DARKNESS.

". . ."

FOR YOU SEE. HE WAS WEARING. A HAT.

"I. Yes. That explains why I don't remember his hair, I suppose."

I SAW THROUGH HIS HAT. TO THE HAIR BENEATH. AND NOW YOU CAN DO THE SAME.

"Okay . . . I suppose that's true. I imagine his hat, like all of our hats, is now invisible. But why would I want to see his hair?"

YOU CAN NOW APPRECIATE ALL MANNERS OF HAIR. ZOYA'S FLOWING LOCKS. EMU'S WHITE CURLS. EMMIE'S SHORT, CAREFULLY CROPPED COIFFURE. CHEDA'S . . . LACK OF HAIR. IT IS ALL WORTH GAZING UPON.

"This conversation is giving me a headache. TX, what exactly did Zoya ask for?"

ZOYA ASKED FOR A WORLD WHERE HATS DID NOT EXIST. I CANNOT REMOVE HATS. BUT WITH MY NANOBOTS, I CAN HIDE HATS. FROM HUMAN OPTICS. I ASSUMED HER REQUEST WAS FOR GAZING UPON THE HAIR UNDERNEATH. IT WAS THE ONLY LOGICAL POSSIBILITY.

". . . Riiiight. Let me go talk to Zoya."

I SHALL REMAIN HERE.

"Zoya!"

. . .

"ZOYA!"

. . .

"You been talking to TX again?"

. . .

"Did you say anything about hats?"

. . .

"Well, all our hats are invisible. And TX says he did it."

. . .

"What *did* you talk to him about?"

. . .

"Like, raiders? And bandits?"

. . .

". . . What, exactly, did you say about the raiders' motivations?"

. . .

"Yeah, no argument, I don't like them either, but what *exactly* did you say?"

. . .

"Wait. You asked for 'a world without . . .'"

. . .

"Zoya, we *really* need to work on your accent."

I MAY HAVE MADE A MISTAKE.

There's this mod that makes all hats invisible. The problem is then you can't see people's hats.

Yeah that's the dumbest thing I've ever said. Bear with me.

See, hats are kind of pretty. But hair is also kind of pretty! And it's also a lot more distinctive, because, seriously, how often do you *not* have all your colonists wearing identical hats?

Mostly, I want to see hats in the main game, but not see hats in the character portraits. I don't need to see at a glance whether someone's wearing a hat, but it seems wrong if they're just walking around hatless in the rain, or fighting off raiders with bare heads. Seems like a bad idea, Morgan. Put on your helmet already. Sheesh.

So I fixed it! This mod removes hats from the character portraits along the top of the screen. But they still wear their hats in the game! That's pretty cool, right?

The name of this mod is entirely inaccurate. Whatever. You've stuck with me this long, you can live with yet another weirdly named mod.

Does not require a new save game - this can be transparently added and removed from any savegame you already have.

TRANSPARENTLY.

LIKE YOUR HATS.

HEY-OOOOOOO
