# A World Without Hat
Rimworld "A World Without Hat" mod

There's this mod that makes all hats invisible. The problem is then you can't see people's hats.

Meanwhile, this mod removes hats from the character portraits along the top of the screen. But they still wear their hats in the game.

The name of this mod is entirely inaccurate and I don't have anything clever to say about it.

Does not require a new save game - this can be transparently added and removed from any savegame you already have.
